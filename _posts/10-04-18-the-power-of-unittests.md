In my current role I am the only Software Development Engineer in Test in charge of all Quality Control Processes and activities in a fast paced <i><b>Continuous Integration</b></i> model. The team that I am a part of is working on modernizing a product platform that is currently deployed in several countries worldwide. The APIs have documentation which describes what endpoints require what <i><b>headers and parameters</i></b>, as well as what different <i><b>response status codes</i></b> to expect and so on. Being short-staffed, I needed to pick a framework that would be <i><b>lightweight</i></b> & <i><b>easy to pick up</i></b>. Also, it should be something the <i><b>entire</i></b> team is comfortable with (I <i><b>stress<i/></b> that the most, because of the following):

<code>When your team is continuously making changes and you have coverage with a good set of tests, your team members will rely on the testing suite prior to merging changes. </code>
